# Assert
## assert_param
Asserts that the condition is true in the `parameter / comptime` domain, used to place constraints on functions


```mojo :no-line-numbers 
from Assert import assert_param
```

We can put compile time assertions in the ensure that the two numbers passed in are positive


```mojo :no-line-numbers 
fn add_positives[x: Int, y: Int]() -> UInt8:
    assert_param[x > 0]()
    assert_param[y > 0]()
    return x + y
```

Let's get the result that's calculated at compile time


```mojo :no-line-numbers 
let res = add_positives[2, 4]()
print(res)
```

Now we'll introduce the error so you can see how it looks, it will always be at the end of the error message:


```mojo :no-line-numbers 
add_positives[-2, 4]()
```

    Expression [2]:6:24:               constraint failed: param assertion failed
        assert_param[x > 0]()
                           ^
    
    expression failed to parse (no further compiler diagnostics)

You can also add a message to change the compiler error output:


```mojo :no-line-numbers 
fn add_positives[x: Int, y: Int]() -> UInt8:
    assert_param[x > 0, "x is not positve, use a positve number over 0"]()
    assert_param[y > 0, "y is not positve, use a positve number over 0"]()
    return x + y

let res = add_positives[-2, -4]()
print(res)
```

    Expression [5]:6:73:               constraint failed: x is not positve, use a positve number over 0
        assert_param[x > 0, "x is not positve, use a positve number over 0"]()
                                                                            ^
    
    expression failed to parse (no further compiler diagnostics)

## debug_assert
Asserts that the condition is true in debug builds, and is removed from the compilation process in release builds


```mojo :no-line-numbers 
from Assert import debug_assert

fn test_debug_assert[x: Int](y: Int):
    debug_assert(x == 42, "x is not equal to 42")
    debug_assert(y == 42, "y is not equal to 42")


test_debug_assert[1](2)
```

debug_assert doesn't work in the playground because it's not a debug build.
