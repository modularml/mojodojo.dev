This is quite possible to wire up, but will require a bit of design work.</p><p>It still bugs me how &quot;return&quot; works the wrong way and break doesn&#39;t work in a &quot;closure taking control flow&quot; function in Swift.

Thank you for your suggestions, but our goal isn&#39;t to design a new language from first principles (been there done that üòÑ), it is to lift an existing ecosystem. We are also not adding general syntactic sugar, we are focused on core systems programming features that Python lacks.</p><h3 id="type-builtin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#type-builtin"><span><code>type</code> builtin</span></a></h3><p>The issue with adding the type bultin to Mojo is that we don&#39;t have a runtime type representation yet.
