MLIR is now widely utilized across the entire industry for AI accelerators, we built it at Google and then open sourced it, and it&#39;s now part of LLVM. LLVM is an umbrella of technologies that includes MLIR, the Clang compiler for C/C++, and the fundamental building blocks like code generation for an x86 processor, so we build directly on top of that as well. This is the core of how we make the hardware go really fast.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-21 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="speeding-up-python" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speeding-up-python"><span>Speeding up Python</span></a></h3><p>Despite Python&#39;s popularity for research and training models, it presents challenges for deploying at scale, often leading teams to rewrite their models in C++. The Modular inference engine was constructed entirely on top of Mojo, and now is the fastest inference engine for TensorFlow and PyTorch models by maximizing the potential of hardware. In comparison to Python, Mojo is compiled, eliminates the GIL, introduces types and adds metaprogramming features which make it a substantially different thing.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="typescript-comparison" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#typescript-comparison"><span>Typescript Comparison</span></a></h3><p>TypeScript is very popular, a lot of people use it and it fits right into the JavaScript ecosystem, Mojo has a similar relationship to Python where it&#39;s a superset. All the Python packages work in Mojo which is really important to us, we don&#39;t want to break the Python community.</p><p>There&#39;s a big difference though, Python already allows you to add types like TypeScript, but they&#39;re just for tools to identify bugs and obvious mistakes in your code, those types aren&#39;t used to improve runtime performance. Mojo takes it to the next step, we often see 10x-20x performance improvements just by adding a few type annotations.</p><p>In the traditional world of Python if you run into performance problems, or if you need access to low level features you have to build a hybrid package of half C/C++ and half Python. In Mojo you can continue writing dynamically typed code, and you can also use lower-level syntax and put more effort into performance, instead of having to switch to a completely different language where the debugger no longer works on both sides.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="mlir-to-unlock-exotic-hardware" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mlir-to-unlock-exotic-hardware"><span>MLIR to unlock exotic hardware</span></a></h3><p>AI isn&#39;t just about a GPU, even though so much thinking around AI technology is focused on that, the Modular team spent years working Google TPUs, they&#39;re highly specialized for AI workloads and scale to exaflops of compute, they&#39;re also internally really weird.</p><p>Mojo is built on top of MLIR which We built back at Google, now it&#39;s being used by basically the who&#39;s who of all the hardware industry. LLVM talks to CPUs and some GPUs, but it&#39;s never been successful at targeting AI accelerators and video optimization engines, and all the other weird hardware that exists in the world. That&#39;s the role that MLIR provides, Mojo fully exposes MLIR and all the nerdery that goes into compiler technology, and gives it to library developers.</p><p>It&#39;s important that you can talk to TPUs or other exotic hardware in their native language, which in the case of a TPU is a 128x128 tile, being able to expose that out in the language is really quite important. It&#39;s more than just CPUs and GPUs, we&#39;ve built it to have really long legs so it can bring us into the future.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="inference-engine" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#inference-engine"><span>Inference Engine</span></a></h3><p>Modular&#39;s building what we called a unified AI engine, people are familiar with PyTorch and TensorFlow and these machine learning frameworks that provide APIs, underneath the covers there&#39;s a lot of technology for getting things onto a CPU and GPU through things like CUDA. And so our engine fits at that level of the stack, the cool thing about it particularly when you&#39;re deploying, is that it talks to a lot of different hardware.</p><p>It also talks to both TensorFlow and PyTorch, so when you&#39;re taking a model from research like a nice PyTorch model off Hugging Face, and you want to deploy this thing. We don&#39;t actually want all of PyTorch in a production Docker container, you want a low dependency efficient way to serve the model. The process of going from PyTorch and into deployment is what the modular technology stack can help with.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="other-cloud-providers-and-mojo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#other-cloud-providers-and-mojo"><span>Other cloud providers and Mojo</span></a></h3><p>SambaNova&#39;s chip is, from my understanding, what&#39;s called a Coarse-grain reconfigurable architecture (CGRA), which is a super parallel and has almost nothing to do with CPUs. Graphcores are apparently lots of things that look like CPUs, but their memories are weird and different, and the way they communicate is very structured. What our technology stack enables companies like SambaNova is a way to implement a compiler for their chip. They&#39;re the experts on their chip, they understand how it works, Modular can provide something to plug into so that they get all the benefits of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="hardware-vendors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hardware-vendors"><span>Hardware Vendors</span></a></h3><p>One of the challenges with hardware accelerators is that the tools provided by non-dominant players often prove difficult to use, especially with regard to compatibility. For instance, Apple&#39;s Core ML which interacts with neural accelerators, isn&#39;t compatible with all models. This often results in complications when attempting to integrate models onto Apple devices.</p><p>These issues are recognized by numerous leaders at software companies integrating AI into their products, they see firsthand the long deployment times and the need for large, specialized, and expensive teams. This is largely due to the discrepancy between the tools used for hardware deployment and those used for AI model training. Companies have to build an entire technology stack from the bottom up, there&#39;s very little code reuse across hardware. And it&#39;s very difficult to track the speed of AI, PyTorch moves fast and you need a very dedicated and responsive team.</p><p>The compiler and technology problems to make the hardware work are really difficult, and so there are a lot of really smart people working on this, but if you&#39;re always focused on getting the next ship out the door, you can&#39;t take a step back and look at this whole technology stack. That&#39;s the leap that modular is driving forward.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="cuda" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cuda"><span>CUDA</span></a></h3><p>The AI industry owes a huge debt of gratitude to CUDA, if you go back to the AlexNet moment it was a confluence of ImageNet, datasets and the fact that GPUs enabled an amount of compute. People forget that CUDA enabled researchers to get a machine learning model running on a GPU, which the hardware was definitely not designed for back in the day. Now AI has taken over and it&#39;s different, but the initial breakthrough was really in a large part thanks to CUDA. A lot of technology has been built on top of CUDA and it&#39;s very powerful, flexible, and hackable and that&#39;s great, but it&#39;s put us into a mode where one vendor has this dominant position and it&#39;s very difficult if you&#39;re a hardware vendor to be able to play in this ecosystem.</p><p>There&#39;s the XLA compiler that Modular staff worked on at Google, and there are new compilers every day being announced by different companies where they&#39;re making make ML go fast, for example on GPUs. The problem with that is that they&#39;ve lost one of the things that made CUDA really powerful, which is the programmability.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="complexity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#complexity"><span>Complexity</span></a></h3><p>As compiler enthusiasts, we transformed AI code generation into a compiler-centric problem, which excluded non-compiler experts. AI isn&#39;t just about matrix operations but involves comprehensive parallel compute tasks including data loading and preprocessing. The battle against CUDA lock-in has resulted in a different lock-in, pushing potential contributors out. Our solution at Modular aims to accommodate all current systems such as TensorFlow or PyTorch without requiring code rewriting, we&#39;re willing to grapple with the complex task of implementing thousands of operators to benefit everyone. Instead of creating a tool for one hardware and framework, we address the broader issue of deployment across various hardwares and frameworks. Mojo&#39;s mission is to simplify the stack, encourage collaboration among various experts, and invite more participation, ultimately to reduce the overwhelming complexity in the AI field.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="package-management" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#package-management"><span>Package Management</span></a></h3><p>The packaging problem is often due to incompatible systems that are lashed together, for example Python packages a lot of C/C++, C&#39;s never had a package manager that&#39;s any good. So you look at these old problems that we&#39;ve been struggling with, get rid of the C code and suddenly packaging is way simpler. This is one of the things that Mojo is providing with a unified language to drive complexity down.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=2196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="debugging-complicated-problems" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#debugging-complicated-problems"><span>Debugging Complicated Problems</span></a></h3><p>What happens when you need to deploy a model through Core ML or one of the many other hardware interfaces, and the results don&#39;t work. Well now you need to know not just PyTorch, not just your model, not just Core ML, but also the translator, compiler and all these other things. You keep digging and you find out it&#39;s handling the edge padding on a convolution slightly differently. All of these tools were supposed to be making it easy aren&#39;t reliable, it&#39;s a leaky abstraction where if something goes wrong you have to understand all of this complexity.</p><p>And so this is what causes it to take three months to deploy a model, leaders ask why it&#39;s taking so long but they don&#39;t realize that the tool set, this fundamental technology that all this stuff is built on top of, it&#39;s not up to high standards. No C programmer would tolerate AI tools of this quality, it&#39;s just crazy.</p><p>But again, this is just the maturity of the AI technology space, and by solving that problem we should see way more inclusion and the kinds of companies that are able to work with AI, and that&#39;ll have a big impact on the world.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=2340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="modular-monetization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#modular-monetization"><span>Modular monetization</span></a></h3><p>The engine itself can stand alone and you can use the engine as a drop-in replacement for running TensorFlow and PyTorch models in production. And so TensorFlow is quite good at production, but we&#39;re showing 3-5x better performance on, for example Intel CPUs, AMD CPUs or an ARM-based Graviton server in AWS. That&#39;s a massive cost savings and it&#39;s also a massive latency improvement, so many of our customers love that because then they can turn around and make their models bigger, which is a huge deal for them.</p><p>One of the things also that our customers love is that Google and Meta don&#39;t actually support TensorFlow or PyTorch, people forget that these are not products, these are open source projects and more like hobbies for the megacorps. So what we&#39;re essentially offering is a supported and performance optimized version of TensorFlow and PyTorch, the enterprises we talked to that care about their costs often they want somebody that they can call. It&#39;s analogous to running your own mail server, very few companies do that, so why do we do it with AI infrastructure.</p><p>Currently it&#39;s because there&#39;s no choice, there&#39;s nobody to reach out to who can actually can do this. The technology platform at Meta and Google has diverged a lot from what the rest of the industry uses, they both have their own chips and specific use cases, so they&#39;re not focused on the traditional CPU, GPU and public cloud use case. Because it&#39;s a product for us we can actually support it, invest a huge amount of energy into it, and it&#39;s why we have such phenomenal results as well.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=2498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="rewriting-libraries" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rewriting-libraries"><span>Rewriting Libraries</span></a></h3><p>In the case of modular and why we built Mojo, our business objective is go make ML really awesome, we care about the matrix multiplications and the convolutions and the core operations that people spend all their time on in AI. And so we rewrote all of that stuff in Mojo, this isn&#39;t like rewriting Matplotlib, this is like rewriting Intel MKL, or the CUDA implementation of these CUDA kernels equivalent. That&#39;s where we&#39;ve put our energy into because that&#39;s what enables unlocking of the hardware, performance, and usability.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=3061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul>`,86)),r(o)])}const m=t(p,[["render",h],["__file","2023-06-23.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/this-week-in-mojo/2023-06-23.html","title":"This Week in Mojo 2023-06-23","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"This Week in Mojo 2023-06-23","date":"2023-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Mojo Dojo","author_site":"https://mojodojo.dev","author_image":"https://mojodojo.dev/hero.png","feed":true,"head":[["meta",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@mojodojodev"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"This Week in Mojo"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"This week in Mojo with language updates, community content, and everything else related to Mojo"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://mojodojo.dev/hero.png"}]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Official Content","slug":"official-content","link":"#official-content","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Community Content","slug":"community-content","link":"#community-content","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Mojo Playground Update","slug":"mojo-playground-update","link":"#mojo-playground-update","children":[{"level":3,"title":"‚≠êÔ∏è New","slug":"‚≠êÔ∏è-new","link":"#‚≠êÔ∏è-new","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"ü¶ã Changed","slug":"ü¶ã-changed","link":"#ü¶ã-changed","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"üõ†Ô∏è Fixed","slug":"üõ†Ô∏è-fixed","link":"#üõ†Ô∏è-fixed","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Mojo Team Answer","slug":"mojo-team-answer","link":"#mojo-team-answer","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Logo and brand community usage","slug":"logo-and-brand-community-usage","link":"#logo-and-brand-community-usage","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"BNF notation for Mojo","slug":"bnf-notation-for-mojo","link":"#bnf-notation-for-mojo","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Three World Problem","slug":"three-world-problem","link":"#three-world-problem","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Technology Mojo Builds on","slug":"technology-mojo-builds-on","link":"#technology-mojo-builds-on","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Speeding up Python","slug":"speeding-up-python","link":"#speeding-up-python","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Typescript Comparison","slug":"typescript-comparison","link":"#typescript-comparison","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"MLIR to unlock exotic hardware","slug":"mlir-to-unlock-exotic-hardware","link":"#mlir-to-unlock-exotic-hardware","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Inference Engine","slug":"inference-engine","link":"#inference-engine","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Other cloud providers and Mojo","slug":"other-cloud-providers-and-mojo","link":"#other-cloud-providers-and-mojo","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Hardware Vendors","slug":"hardware-vendors","link":"#hardware-vendors","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"CUDA","slug":"cuda","link":"#cuda","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Complexity","slug":"complexity","link":"#complexity","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Package Management","slug":"package-management","link":"#package-management","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Debugging Complicated Problems","slug":"debugging-complicated-problems","link":"#debugging-complicated-problems","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Modular monetization","slug":"modular-monetization","link":"#modular-monetization","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Rewriting Libraries","slug":"rewriting-libraries","link":"#rewriting-libraries","children":[]}]}],"git":{"contributors":[{"name":"Mojo Dojo","username":"Mojo Dojo","email":"mojodojodev@gmail.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Mojo Dojo"},{"name":"Jack Clayton","username":"Jack Clayton","email":"jackos@me.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Jack Clayton"}]},"filePathRelative":"this-week-in-mojo/2023-06-23.md"}');export{m as comp,g as data};
