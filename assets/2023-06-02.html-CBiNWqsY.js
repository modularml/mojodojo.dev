I plan to talk to Chris about how he plans it to become a true Python superset that will run existing Python code out of the box.</p><p>So far, Mojo is a separate language (they have struct but not class, Int but not int, etc.), and their ‚ÄúCPython compatibility‚Äù strategy involves calling a helper function that you pass the name of a module, and it will import that module and execute it in CPython, returning a Mojo proxy object. It then treats CPython as a separate language runtime and when values are passed between Mojo and CPython they are ‚Äúmarshalled‚Äù (boxing/unboxing Int/int, etc.). This is syntactically very smooth, because Mojo and Python have compatible syntax (so you can write e.g. x+y where x is a Mojo value and y a CPython object), but doesn‚Äôt speed up running CPython at all.</p><p>I presume that the reported speedups on PyTorch etc. are obtained by rewriting key parts of the PyTorch kernel in Mojo, applying the optimizations shown in the notebooks on the Mojo site.</p><h2 id="lex-fridman-interview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lex-fridman-interview"><span>Lex Fridman Interview</span></a></h2>',20)),a("p",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Lex Fridman",-1)),e[2]||(e[2]=t(" did a 3.5 hour ")),e[3]||(e[3]=a("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdJQ8iVTwj8",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"interview with Chris Lattner",-1)),e[4]||(e[4]=t(", these are answers directly related to Mojo that give new information or more context for ")),n(r,{to:"/mojo-team-answers.html"},{default:d(()=>e[0]||(e[0]=[t("Mojo Team Answers")])),_:1}),e[5]||(e[5]=t(", but the whole interview is worth watching for more general philosophy and Modular specific information."))]),e[7]||(e[7]=o('<h3 id="curly-braces" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#curly-braces"><span>Curly Braces</span></a></h3><p>Curly brace languages are typically run through formatting tools now which automatically indents them, so you end up with indentation and curly braces, why not get rid of the clutter and have a more beautiful thing?

But you can&#39;t use those features on things like a GPU due to performance costs, so we take the interpreter and allow it to run at compile time. This gives us Python style expressive API&#39;s that enable libraries like PyTorch, with no performance penalty.</p><p>This is similar to newer languages like Zig, which allow you use the core language during compile time the same way you would during runtime. As opposed to C++ templating where it&#39;s a completely different language and universe, one of the goals of Mojo is to make things really easy to use and learn so there&#39;s a natural stepping stone.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 16:23</a></p><h3 id="autotune-and-adaptive-compilation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#autotune-and-adaptive-compilation"><span>Autotune and adaptive compilation</span></a></h3><p>Libraries like PyTorch have pushed ML towards an abstract specification of a compute problem, which then gets mapped in a whole bunch of different ways, this is why it has become a metaprogramming problem.</p><p>Hardware systems and algorithms are really complicated, most programmers don&#39;t want to know the intricate details of how the hardware actually works, so how do we allow people to build more abstracted and portable code, a lot of the algorithms are the same but parameters like cache size, vector length or tail size might need to change to optimize for different hardware.</p><p>Instead of having humans go and test all these things with different parameters which can grow to complex multidimensional spaces, why don&#39;t we have computers do that for us. So you can specify different options and have the compiler empirically test what the fastest implementation is for the target you&#39;re compiling to.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=1262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 21:02</a></p><h3 id="speedup-moving-from-cpython-to-mojo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speedup-moving-from-cpython-to-mojo"><span>Speedup moving from CPython to Mojo</span></a></h3><p>Interpreters have an extra layer of bytecode that they have to go and read and interpret, and it makes them slow from this perspective. The first thing that converting your code to Mojo does is get a 2x to 10x speedup without changing the code.</p><p>In Python everything&#39;s an object, the memory layout of all objects is the same, so you&#39;re always passing around a pointer to the data which has overhead from allocation and reference counting, so you can move that out of the heap and into registers and that&#39;s another 10x speedup.</p><p>Modern CPU&#39;s allow you to do Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) to run the same operation on a vector of data which Python doesn&#39;t expose, Mojo builds it into the language and this can lead to more huge speedups.</p><p>Python also has the Global Interpret Lock (GIL) due to reference counting and other implementation details, in Mojo you can take direct advantage of threads.</p><p>There&#39;s even more performance improvements via things like memory hierarchy etc. Mojo allows you to take advantage of all these powerful things that have been built into hardware over time.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=1521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 22:21</a></p><h3 id="mojo-types" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mojo-types"><span>Mojo Types</span></a></h3><p>Python has types like strings, integers, dictionaries etc. but they all live at runtime, in Mojo you specify what the actual types are which allows the compiler to do way better optimizations, gets rid of the expensive indirections, and gives you code completion. You can progressively adopt types where you want them, but you don&#39;t have to use them if you don&#39;t want to. Our opinion is not that types are the wrong or right thing, but they&#39;re a useful thing.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=1869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 31:09</a></p><h3 id="migration" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#migration"><span>Migration</span></a></h3><p>Mojo is aiming to be a full superset of Python, the world went through a very long painful migration from Python 2 to Python 3, I don&#39;t want people to have to go through that if they want to move to Mojo, they shouldn&#39;t have to rewrite all their code.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=2125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 35:25</a></p><h3 id="built-in-types-like-c-int" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#built-in-types-like-c-int"><span>Built in types like C++ <code>int</code></span></a></h3><p>I want to get magic out of the compilers and put it into the libraries, we can build an <code>Int</code> that&#39;s beautiful and has an amazing API and does all the things you expect an integer to do, but maybe you don&#39;t like it and want to build a <code>BigInt</code>, you can do that and it&#39;s not a second class citizen.

Mojo is currently like a <code>0.1</code>, and in a year from now it will be way more useful to a wider variety of people, but we decided to launch it early so we can build it with the community. We have a <a href="https://docs.modular.com/mojo/roadmap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap that&#39;s transparent about the current state</a> we&#39;re optimizing for building the right thing the right way.

This allows you to pass objects like collections and strings into a function, and it doesn&#39;t copy any data unless you mutate it. This is the best of both worlds, where the original object won&#39;t be modified if you mutate it inside a function, but it also won&#39;t copy the data leading to a performance hit if it doesn&#39;t need to. The language allows the type author to express this behaviour without forcing it into all cases.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=2908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 48:28</a></p><h3 id="ownership" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ownership"><span>Ownership</span></a></h3><p>It&#39;s related to work done in the Rust, Swift, C++ and many other communities, it&#39;s a body of work that&#39;s been developing over many years. Mojo takes the best ideas and remixes them so you get the power of the Rust ownership model, but you don&#39;t have to deal with it when you don&#39;t want to, which is a major help in usability and teaching.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=3213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 53:33</a></p><h3 id="solving-complexity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#solving-complexity"><span>Solving Complexity</span></a></h3><p>A tensor is like an abstraction around a gigantic parralelizable data set, using frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow you can also represent the operations over those data sets, which you can then map onto parralelizable cores or machines. This has an enabled an explosion in AI and accelerators, but also an explosion in complexity.</p><p>Researchers are smart in various domains like calculus but they don&#39;t want to know anything about the hardware or C++, so they train the model and then you have teams who are specialized in deploying the model which might have to split out onto various machines so the complexity explodes, making changes takes weeks or months because all these teams with different expertise need to coordinate which is always a huge problem.</p><p>Why is it so difficult that it takes a team of 45 people to deploy a model when it&#39;s so easy to train? If you dig into this, every layer is problematic. PyTorch and Tensorflow weren&#39;t really designed for this complicated world we have today, they were designed for when models could be trained and fit onto a single GPU. Tensorflow can scale to many machines, but most researchers are using PyTorch which doesn&#39;t have those capabilities.</p><p>The main thing that Modular is fighting against is all this complexity:</p><ul><li>Hardware accelerators and software stacks to interact with the hardware</li><li>Modeling constantly changing with new research and huge amounts of diversity</li><li>Serving technology like zero copy networking, asyncio etc. that hasn&#39;t made it into machine learning</li></ul><p>These things have been built up over many years in their own silos and there hasn&#39;t been a first principles rethink, Modular has an amazing team to create a unified platform that solves this issue because we&#39;ve worked on a lot of these silos including Tensorflow, TPUs, PyTorch Core, ONNXRuntime, Apple accelerators etc.</p><p>Our joking mission statement is to &quot;Save the world from terrible AI software&quot;, so we need a syntax, and we wouldn&#39;t have to build the programming language if it already existed, if Python was already good enough we would have just used it, we&#39;re not doing very large scale expensive engineering projects for the sake of it, it&#39;s to solve a problem.</p><p>In the early days of PyTorch and Tensorflow things were basically CPU and CUDA, so for a dense layer with matrix multiplication you could kick off a CUDA kernel on GPU, or use something like Intel MKL for CPU. Now you have an explosion of hardware on one end with thousands of different types of hardware, and explosion of development in AI models on the other end with thousands of different operators. From giant TPU stacks to CPU&#39;s on mobile devices, whenever someone releases new hardware they need teams of people rewriting the compiler and kernel technology, which keeps out the little competitors. There is only a handful of people compiler experts out there which excludes a tonne of people. Mojo and the Modular stack brings programmability back into this world, allowing more general programmers to extend the stack without having to go hack the compiler itself. This opens it up to researchers and hardware innovators and people who know things that compiler people don&#39;t know.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=3484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 58:04</a></p><h3 id="first-principles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#first-principles"><span>First Principles</span></a></h3><p>There have been a number of languages that have attempted to speed up Python, with Mojo we&#39;re trying to understand what the limit of the hardware and physics is, and how to express that in software. Typically that ends up being a memory problem, you can do a lot of math inside these accelerators, but you get bottlenecked sending data back and forth to memory as the training size gets large. Typically engineers that are really familiar with the hardware and specific models would optimize for a single use case, but these models are getting so large that details can&#39;t fit in one humans head, so we need to generalize. What the Modular stack allows is someone to use it for a new problem and it&#39;ll generally work quite well.</p><p>We&#39;re not working forwards from making Python a little bit better, we&#39;re working backwards from the limits of physics.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=5210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 1:26:50</a></p><h3 id="cpython-interop" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cpython-interop"><span>CPython Interop</span></a></h3><p>We use the CPython existing interpreter which runs Python bytecode, Mojo uses the CPython objects to make it fully compatible, as well as the ability to use all the C packages, so Mojo keeps the objects in that representation when they&#39;re coming from CPython.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=5874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 1:37:56</a></p><h3 id="static-metaprogramming-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#static-metaprogramming-features"><span>Static Metaprogramming Features</span></a></h3><p>Python has amazing dynamic metaprogramming features, and they translate to beautiful static metaprogramming features which has profound implications.

I have a tonne of respect for Guido in how he steered such a gigantic community towards what it is today. It was really important to get his eyes and feedback on Mojo, what he&#39;s most concerned about is how to avoid fragmenting the community. It&#39;s really important we&#39;re a good member of the community, we think Guido is interested in the path out of the reasons why Python is slow. Python can suddenly go all the places it&#39;s never been able to go before, so it can have even more impact on the world.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=6611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 1:50:11</a></p><h3 id="python-using-mojo-code" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#python-using-mojo-code"><span>Python using Mojo code</span></a></h3><p>We learnt a bunch of tricks along the way converting an entire community of programmers from Objective-C to Swift, we built a lot of machinery to deeply integrate with the Objective-C runtime, we&#39;re doing the same thing with Python. When a new library gets built in Mojo people should be able to use it in Python. We need to vend Python interfaces to the Mojo types, that&#39;s what we did in Swift and it worked great, it&#39;s a huge challenge to implement for the compiler people, but it benefits millions of users and really helps adoption.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=6809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 1:53:29</a></p><h3 id="unifying-theory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unifying-theory"><span>Unifying Theory</span></a></h3><p>If you look at companies like OpenAI building huge ML models, they&#39;re innovating in the data collection and model architecture side, but they&#39;re spending a lot of time writing CUDA kernels. How much faster could all that progress go if they weren&#39;t hand writing all those CUDA kernels. There are projects trying to solve subsets of this problem but it&#39;s fragmenting the space, Mojo provides a <code>Unifying Theory</code> to stop this problem slowing people down.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=7171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 1:59:31</a></p><h3 id="julia" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#julia"><span>Julia</span></a></h3><p>I think Julia is a great language with a lovely community, but it&#39;s a different angle to Mojo, our goal is to take something great in Python and make it even better, so programmers don&#39;t have to learn an entirely new language.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=7583" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 2:06:25</a></p><h3 id="adoption" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adoption"><span>Adoption</span></a></h3><p>The thing that will most help adoption is you don&#39;t have to rewrite all your Python code, you can learn a new trick, and grow your knowledge that way.

This has known problems and will need to be reworked when we get traits/typeclasses/protocols filled in. Do you have a specific interest/concern in mind?

In the absence of traits/protocols (which is scheduled to start soon) we can&#39;t reason about what members a generic AnyType has, nor can we constrain that type. This is actually a pretty big deal, because we don&#39;t have the infra to map back to what a substituted type&#39;s destructors are. As a consequence of this, it is only possible to use trivial types like Int/FP with generic algorithms. This is incredibly constraining right now üôÅ</p><p>There is a separate issue where register_passable and memory-only types have different concrete ABIs / conventions. This is solvable in a simple way (just treat register passable types as memory abi when generic) or a fancier way (delay binding of ABI until type substitution)... but until we solve the trait issue, we&#39;ll still only be able to express generic algorithms over trivial types, even if they are memory only. So solving this in the immediate term isn&#39;t much of a relief.</p><p>The best workarounds right now are pretty ugly:</p><ul><li>Limit your generic code to trivial register passable types; e.g. add an explicit delete() method that you manually manage instead of a <strong>del</strong> method that is automatically invoked.</li><li>Copy and paste things to make them non-generic.</li></ul><p>sorry, this is pretty annoying to me too. I really want to get on top of this of course.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/271#issuecomment-1565709849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-05-28 Github
