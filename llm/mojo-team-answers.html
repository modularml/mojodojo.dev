We prefer Swift&#39;s approach to show that an API is unsafe through naming, for example we should rename the Mojo <code>Pointer</code> to <code>UnsafePointer</code>, instead of propagating an effect that the user has to manage. Unsafe code in Rust also makes it easy to unknowingly expose Undefined Behaviour (UB) when interacting with the borrow checker if you don&#39;t follow the rules, we make different tradeoffs to expose less potential UB when writing unsafe code.</p><p>Pointers serve an important function even for safe code, it allows type-erasing a reference into an arbitrary container that holds a value in memory, just like a safe reference does. This is a pretty important thing, but you really want this to be safe for the common use-case. Such a thing would not support pointer arithmetic or indexing though, this is something a Slice type would support.</p><ul><li><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884/1124302001430339616/1124437937640194120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-07-01 Discord Chris Lattner</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884/1098713601386233997/1108969825008615475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-05-19 Discord Reply Chris Lattner</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884/1105161023218008094/1105223842605039626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-05-09 Discord Reply Chris Lattner</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/DG-VLezRkYQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube: Unsafe Rust Undefined Behavior</a></li></ul><h3 id="loose-typing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#loose-typing"><span>Loose Typing</span></a></h3><p>This is an evolving part of the language and likely another difference we pull into the <code>fn</code> vs <code>def</code> world, in a <code>def</code> we could default to getting objects for literals, but within a <code>fn</code> you get typed literals.

This is why it has become a metaprogramming problem, say you have a neural net, now run it with batch size 1000, do a mapping across batch, or run it across 1000 GPUs/CPUs.</p><p>Hardware systems and algorithms are really complicated, most programmers don&#39;t want to know how the intricate details of how the hardware actually works, so how do we allow people to build more abstracted and portable code, a lot of the algorithms are the same but parameters like cache size, vector length or tail size might need to change to optimize for different hardware.</p><p>Instead of having humans go and test all these things with different parameters which can grow to complex multidimensional spaces, why don&#39;t we have computers do that for us. So you can specify different options and have the compiler empirically test what the fastest implementation is for the target you&#39;re compiling to.</p><p>Python has amazing dynamic metaprogramming features, and they translate to beautiful static metaprogramming features which has profound implications. People use Python for things it wasn&#39;t meant to do, because it was designed very thoughtfully in this space.</p><p>One of the things that makes Python very beautiful is it&#39;s very dynamic and expressive through the powerful dynamic metaprogramming features. But you can&#39;t use those features on things like a GPU due to performance costs, so we take the interpreter and allow it to run at compile time. This gives us Python style expressive API&#39;s that enable libraries like PyTorch, with no performance penalty.</p><p>This is similar to newer languages like Zig, which allow you use the core language during compile time the same way you would during runtime. As opposed to C++ templating where it&#39;s a completely different language and universe, one of the goals of Mojo is to make things really easy to use and learn so there&#39;s a natural stepping stone.</p><p>One of the cool things that Mojo provides is an extremely powerful parametric metaprogramming system (see the language design doc for a brief intro) which allows extending the compiler itself in mojo, so you can invent your own combinators. This is very important, because different accelerators have different cool features and we are not looking for a watered down programming model.</p><p>This isn&#39;t fully documented yet, and there are a few missing pieces we want to wrap up before doing so, but this provides a pretty different programming model than existing systems.</p><p>One way to say this is that Mojo is taking a lot of the power out of the compiler and putting it into libraries, allowing Mojo developers to radically extend the language. Python already has this but does so with super dynamic reflective metaprogramming, so this is an old idea done in a new way</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 16:23</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=1262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 21:02</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=6321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 1:45:20</a></li></ul><h3 id="compile-time-metaprogramming-relationship-to-mlir" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compile-time-metaprogramming-relationship-to-mlir"><span>Compile time metaprogramming relationship to MLIR</span></a></h3><p>Mojo has great support for evaluating fairly arbitrary expressions at compile time with an interpreter that (under the covers) ends up calling an MLIR dialect&#39;s fold operations.</p><p>These then get wrapped up in structs to give a new programmable veneer etc. Check out the Bool workbook example in the documentation for a simple example of doing this with the index dialect.</p><p>Mojo is designed &quot;for&quot; MLIR in this way - MLIR can talk to roughly anything that computes, and it is very important (over time) for Mojo to scale into new forms of computation, whether it be low level things like low-level tensorcore operators, mid-level things like a shape dialect, or high level things like an ML operator graph.</p><p>Right now many folks on the channel are excited about a Python++, but Mojo was designed to work backwards from the &quot;speed of light&quot; of hardware and accelerators.

The implementation is almost always different (given that each language has a different frontend setup), but the way you implement things wants a lot of the same underlying bits. Other than that the only real reuse I&#39;ve gotten between frontends is sharing methodology on how to actually implement the different features, like code completion/hover/etc. Having a good reference is extremely useful, given that implementing some features can be really complex if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing.</p><h2 id="implementation-details" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#implementation-details"><span>Implementation details</span></a></h2><h3 id="init-uninitialized-objects-in-fn" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#init-uninitialized-objects-in-fn"><span>Init uninitialized objects in <code>fn</code></span></a></h3><p>This is effectively how the Mojo compiler works internally, and we fudge a couple of things for sake of simplicity of model.

Including things like ownership and no GC. We also think there is room for a new language that is easier to deploy, scales down to small envelopes, works directly with the full Python ecosystem, is designed for ML and for MLIR from first principles, etc.</p><p>Julia is far more mature and advanced in many ways.

All the Python packages work in Mojo which is really important to us, we don&#39;t want to break the Python community.</p><p>There&#39;s a big difference though, Python already allows you to add types like TypeScript, but they&#39;re just for tools to identify bugs and obvious mistakes in your code, those types aren&#39;t used to improve runtime performance. Mojo takes it to the next step, we often see 10x-20x performance improvements just by adding a few type annotations.</p><p>In the traditional world of Python if you run into performance problems, or if you need access to low level features you have to build a hybrid package of half C/C++ and half Python. In Mojo you can continue writing dynamically typed code, and you can also use lower-level syntax and put more effort into performance, instead of having to switch to a completely different language where the debugger no longer works on both sides.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="rust" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rust"><span>Rust</span></a></h3><p>I don&#39;t think that mojo has any burden to prove novelty vs rust. We&#39;re happy to adopt good ideas from Rust as with all other existing languages. Graydon himself was very happy for Rust to pull good ideas when he started it, and wasn&#39;t ashamed to admit it. Mojo is similar.</p><p>I also don&#39;t see Rust and Mojo in competition, while I&#39;m hoping that Mojo can learn from and improve vs Rust in various areas, they&#39;re clearly servicing different segments of the world. Yes there is some crossover, but Rust is far more mature than Mojo and Rust is continuously improving as well. If you&#39;d like to continue using Rust, go for it 😀.</p><p>If you&#39;re interested in language nerdery, then yes, there are ways in which Mojo can provide better performance than Rust. There are two categories:</p><ol><li><p>There are very low level implementation details (e.g. borrow by default instead of move, moves not implying memcpy etc) that can affect idiomatic use of the language at scale. As others say, it will be difficult to know how these work out until Mojo is more complete and there are more at-scale applications like your caching system. Mojo&#39;s trait system in particular is missing, and it&#39;s hard to write much realistic generic code without that!</p></li><li><p>Mojo open new frontiers for GPUs and other accelerators. We can all have different opinions about what the &quot;end of moore&#39;s&quot; law means for computing, but if computers keep getting weirder, and if that matters for important workloads that you care about, then Mojo will be interesting because it can talk to them in ways that other languages weren&#39;t really built for.</p></li></ol><p>That said if you care about Fibonacci on X86 cpus, both Rust and Mojo (and Clang and many many others) are all zero cost languages that boil down to LLVM. As such, any advantage claimed on such a workload will be more about accidental implementation details than anything else and could be easily fixed.</p><ul><li><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884/1122302305438539826/1122372150146383906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-25 Discord Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="codon" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#codon"><span>Codon</span></a></h3><p>Codon is a cool project, but fundamentally different and doesn&#39;t meet the objectives outlined on our &quot;why use mojo?&quot; page.

MLIR is now widely utilized across the entire industry for AI accelerators, we built it at Google and then open sourced it, and it&#39;s now part of LLVM. LLVM is an umbrella of technologies that includes MLIR, the Clang compiler for C/C++, and the fundamental building blocks like code generation for an x86 processor, so we build directly on top of that as well. This is the core of how we make the hardware go really fast.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-21 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="how-is-it-faster-than-python" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-is-it-faster-than-python"><span>How is it faster than Python</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s the trick with Mojo, our goal is not to make dynamic python magically fast. Yes, we are quite a bit faster at dynamic code (because we have compiler instead of an interpreter) but that isn&#39;t by relying on a &#39;sufficiently smart&#39; compiler to remove the dynamism, it is just because &quot;compilers&quot; instead of &quot;interpreters&quot;.</p><p>The reason Mojo is way way faster than Python is because it give programmers control over static behavior and makes it super easy to adopt incrementally where it makes sense. The key payoff of this is that the compilation process is quite simple, there are no JITs required, you get predictable and controllable performance, and you still get dynamism where you ask for it.</p><p>Mojo doesn&#39;t aim to magically make Python code faster with no work, although it does accidentally do that a little, it gives you control so you can care about performance where you want to.</p><p>The Modular inference engine was constructed entirely on top of Mojo, and now is the fastest inference engine for TensorFlow and PyTorch models by maximizing the potential of hardware.</p><ul><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35809658#35811170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-05-04 Hackernews Chris Lattner</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="build-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#build-system"><span>Build System</span></a></h3><p>Mojo shifts the discussion on that a bit.

We need to invest more in this in the future.</p><p>Various existing languages have problems with &quot;LLVM compilation time&quot;, particularly when they claim zero abstraction costs and then expect LLVM to provide that for them.

Today, that magic is bundled into a handful of higher-order functions, like parallelize and vectorize_unroll, and as time continues, Mojo will ship with more &quot;batteries&quot; that mean most developers won&#39;t have to worry about SIMD, unrolling, etc. You just need to slap a few decorators on your functions/loops and call a function.</p><h3 id="compiler-guidance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compiler-guidance"><span>Compiler Guidance</span></a></h3><p>Mojo already gives a couple warnings that suggest better things to do.

Keep in mind that owned can/should be used in a lot of places as a performance optimization, e.g. the arguments to a &quot;memberwise init&quot;. For non-copyable types this is required for correctness to handle ownership correctly, and for copyable types it allows you to avoid the copies if you&#39;re careful.</p><p>Like in Rust, you should not make your type implicitly copyable if that operation is expensive. If you want to control all copies and force ownership on the users of your type, you should instead implement an explicit x.copy() method which will make everything explicit in the code.</p><p>In Mojo, that concept of unique ownership is orthogonal to copyability, which is something that a number of other languages (e.g. Swift) got conflated.</p><p>Having implicit moves is super confusing to many programmers, and makes the error messages way more difficult to explain back when something goes wrong.</p><h3 id="rust-like-syntax-for-lifetimes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rust-like-syntax-for-lifetimes"><span>Rust-like syntax for lifetimes</span></a></h3><p>Yes, this is in the roadway coming soon, this is actually one of the next major features that will land.</p><h3 id="value-semantics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#value-semantics"><span>Value semantics</span></a></h3><p>Mojo doesn&#39;t force, but enables the use of value semantics.

This is the best of both worlds, where the original object won&#39;t be modified if you mutate it inside a function, but it also won&#39;t copy the data leading to a performance hit if it doesn&#39;t need to.

And so TensorFlow is quite good at production, but we&#39;re showing 3-5x better performance on, for example Intel CPUs, AMD CPUs or an ARM-based Graviton server in AWS. That&#39;s a massive cost savings and it&#39;s also a massive latency improvement, so many of our customers love that because then they can turn around and make their models bigger, which is a huge deal for them.</p><p>One of the things also that our customers love is that Google and Meta don&#39;t actually support TensorFlow or PyTorch, people forget that these are not products, these are open source projects and more like hobbies for the megacorps. So what we&#39;re essentially offering is a supported and performance optimized version of TensorFlow and PyTorch, the enterprises we talked to that care about their costs often they want somebody that they can call.

This has an enabled an explosion in AI and accelerators, but also an explosion in complexity.</p><p>Researchers are smart in various domains like calculus but they don&#39;t want to know anything about the hardware or C++, so they train the model and then you have teams who are specialized in deploying the model which might have to split out onto various machines so the complexity explodes, making changes takes weeks or months because all these teams with different expertise need to coordinate which is always a huge problem.</p><p>Why is it so difficult that it takes a team of 45 people to deploy a model when it&#39;s so easy to train? If you dig into this, every layer is problematic. PyTorch and Tensorflow weren&#39;t really designed for this complicated world we have today, they were designed for when models could be trained and fit onto a single GPU. Tensorflow can scale to many machines, but most researchers are using PyTorch which doesn&#39;t have those capabilities.</p><p>The main thing that Modular is fighting against is all this complexity:</p><ul><li>Hardware accelerators and software stacks to interact with the hardware</li><li>Modeling constantly changing with new research and huge amounts of diversity</li><li>Serving technology like zero copy networking, asyncio etc. that hasn&#39;t made it into machine learning</li></ul><p>These things have been built up over many years in their own silos and there hasn&#39;t been a first principles rethink, Modular has an amazing team to create a unified platform that solves this issue because we&#39;ve worked on a lot of these silos including Tensorflow, TPUs, PyTorch Core, ONNXRuntime, Apple accelerators etc.</p><p>Our joking mission statement is to &quot;Save the world from terrible AI software&quot;, so we need a syntax, and we wouldn&#39;t have to build the programming language if it already existed, if Python was already good enough we would have just used it, we&#39;re not doing very large scale expensive engineering projects for the sake of it, it&#39;s to solve a problem.</p><p>In the early days of PyTorch and Tensorflow things were basically CPU and CUDA, so for a dense layer with matrix multiplication you could kick off a CUDA kernel on GPU, or use something like Intel MKL for CPU. Now you have an explosion of hardware on one end with thousands of different types of hardware, and explosion of development in AI models on the other end with thousands of different operators. From giant TPU stacks to CPU&#39;s on mobile devices, whenever someone releases new hardware they need teams of people rewriting the compiler and kernel technology, which keeps out the little competitors. There is only a handful of people compiler experts out there which excludes a tonne of people. Mojo and the Modular stack brings programmability back into this world, allowing more general programmers to extend the stack without having to go hack the compiler itself. This opens it up to researchers and hardware innovators and people who know things that compiler people don&#39;t know.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=3484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 58:04</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="hardware-complexity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hardware-complexity"><span>Hardware Complexity</span></a></h3><p>Hardware is getting very complicated, part of my thesis is that it&#39;s going to get a lot more complicated, part of what&#39;s exciting about what we&#39;re building is the universal platform to support the world as we get more exotic hardware, and they don&#39;t have to rewrite their code every time a new device comes out.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=8217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 2:16:57</a></li></ul><h3 id="first-principles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#first-principles"><span>First Principles</span></a></h3><p>There have been a number of languages that have attempted to speed up Python, with Mojo we&#39;re trying to understand what the limit of the hardware and physics is, and how to express that in software. Typically that ends up being a memory problem, you can do a lot of math inside these accelerators, but you get bottlenecked sending data back and forth to memory as the training size gets large. Typically engineers that are really familiar with the hardware and specific models would optimize for a single use case, but these models are getting so large that details can&#39;t fit in one humans head, so we need to generalize. What the Modular stack allows is someone to use it for a new problem and it&#39;ll generally work quite well.</p><p>We&#39;re not working forwards from making Python a little bit better, we&#39;re working backwards from the limits of physics.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/pdJQ8iVTwj8?t=5210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-02 Lex Fridman Interview 1:26:50</a></li></ul><h3 id="python-creator-guido-van-rossums-s-thoughts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#python-creator-guido-van-rossums-s-thoughts"><span>Python creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guido van Rossums&#39;s</a> thoughts</span></a></h3><p>We talked before Mojo launched, he found it very interesting.

They&#39;re the experts on their chip, they understand how it works, Modular can provide something to plug into so that they get all the benefits of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="hardware-vendors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hardware-vendors"><span>Hardware Vendors</span></a></h3><p>One of the challenges with hardware accelerators is that the tools provided by non-dominant players often prove difficult to use, especially with regard to compatibility. For instance, Apple&#39;s Core ML which interacts with neural accelerators, isn&#39;t compatible with all models. This often results in complications when attempting to integrate models onto Apple devices.</p><p>These issues are recognized by numerous leaders at software companies integrating AI into their products, they see firsthand the long deployment times and the need for large, specialized, and expensive teams. This is largely due to the discrepancy between the tools used for hardware deployment and those used for AI model training. Companies have to build an entire technology stack from the bottom up, there&#39;s very little code reuse across hardware. And it&#39;s very difficult to track the speed of AI, PyTorch moves fast and you need a very dedicated and responsive team.</p><p>The compiler and technology problems to make the hardware work are really difficult, and so there are a lot of really smart people working on this, but if you&#39;re always focused on getting the next ship out the door, you can&#39;t take a step back and look at this whole technology stack. That&#39;s the leap that modular is driving forward.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="cuda" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cuda"><span>CUDA</span></a></h3><p>The AI industry owes a huge debt of gratitude to CUDA, if you go back to the AlexNet moment it was a confluence of ImageNet, datasets and the fact that GPUs enabled an amount of compute. People forget that CUDA enabled researchers to get a machine learning model running on a GPU, which the hardware was definitely not designed for back in the day. Now AI has taken over and it&#39;s different, but the initial breakthrough was really in a large part thanks to CUDA. A lot of technology has been built on top of CUDA and it&#39;s very powerful, flexible, and hackable and that&#39;s great, but it&#39;s put us into a mode where one vendor has this dominant position and it&#39;s very difficult if you&#39;re a hardware vendor to be able to play in this ecosystem.</p><p>There&#39;s the XLA compiler that Modular staff worked on at Google, and there are new compilers every day being announced by different companies where they&#39;re making make ML go fast, for example on GPUs. The problem with that is that they&#39;ve lost one of the things that made CUDA really powerful, which is the programmability.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h2 id="max-engine" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#max-engine"><span>MAX Engine</span></a></h2><p><a href="https://docs.modular.com/engine/faq.html#do-we-really-need-yet-another-inference-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Official FAQ</a></p><p>Modular&#39;s building what we called the MAX engine, people are familiar with PyTorch and TensorFlow and these machine learning frameworks that provide APIs, underneath the covers there&#39;s a lot of technology for getting things onto a CPU and GPU through things like CUDA. And so our engine fits at that level of the stack, the cool thing about it particularly when you&#39;re deploying, is that it talks to a lot of different hardware.</p><p>It also talks to both TensorFlow and PyTorch, so when you&#39;re taking a model from research like a nice PyTorch model off Hugging Face, and you want to deploy this thing. We don&#39;t actually want all of PyTorch in a production Docker container, you want a low dependency efficient way to serve the model. The process of going from PyTorch and into deployment is what the modular technology stack can help with.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/-8TbsCUuwQQ?t=1391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023-06-20 YouTube Chris Lattner</a></li></ul><h3 id="frameworks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#frameworks"><span>Frameworks</span></a></h3><p>It’s a unified engine that enables multi-framework support, many users aren’t just using PyTorch (TensorFlow, JAX etc)</p><p>It integrates natively with Mojo 🔥 for a completely new high performance programming model that enables many things outside of just pure model execution performance.</p><h3 id="runtime" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#runtime"><span>Runtime</span></a></h3><p>Our runtime is designed to be modular.
